Platforms:
The app only has an android folder. The package.json file indicates that there is a script to run the iOS version, but there is no iOS folder in the project. The app doesn't work on iOS.

The eslint:
The eslint script is available but it is not working, because a file is missing. It is not mandatory to have it but it is standard practice to keep code consistent, so it is a big plus to have it. 

Coding:
- The strings are hardcoded. There is no possibility to add i18n, or a single resource file to easily change the strings.
- The styling in the app is not ideal. There is no themeing, no typography defined, no spacing handled, no colors library.

There are also several points in the code that could have been done better. For example:
- Difficult to understand code like: https://github.com/Pignatar0md/news/blob/master/src/screens/ArticlesScreen.js#L47
- Unnecessary use of else, when it should have been a precondition: https://github.com/Pignatar0md/news/blob/master/src/screens/ArticlesScreen.js#L49
- Unnecessary axios wrapper:
